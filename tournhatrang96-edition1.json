      "Description": "Po Nagar Cham temple complex was built between 8th and 11th centuries by the Cham people who once ruled the central plain of Vietnam. The Cham people, who were Hindu in origin, had their own Sanskrit-based script. They are renowned for their skills in sculpture and architecture and left behind a legacy of artifacts and temple settlements not only in Vietnam, but also Cambodia and Thailand. In the 14th century, the Kingdom of Champa fell into the hand of the invading Viet, whose descendants are today the Vietnamese people. A small minority of Cham people, now an ethnic minority, still live in the central plain somewhere near Danang. Although most Cham people have converted to Islam, they still worship their gods at Po Nagar Cham Towers during annual religious festival of Thap Ba, which falls around the end of April and the beginning of May. Po Nagar Cham Towers were built to honour the goddess Po Nagar- literally translated as 'The mother of the Country' -who is said to have taught agricultural and weaving skills to the Cham people. Later, historians have come to identify Po Nagar with the Hindu goddesses Bhagavati, the wife of Shiva, and Durga, the buffalo-demon slayer. The towers of Po Nagar Cham are square red brick structure with protruding support frames and tapering roofs. There were once ten buildings, each dedicated to a different deity, but now only four remain. The tallest building, at 25 metres, the Po Nagar Kalan, is the most impressive. Here, Po Nagar was worshipped and, according to historical stone inscriptions, animal sacrifices were made in her honour.To the centre of the complex, stands a tower of Cri Cambhu, goddess of fertility. The other two temples are the shrines of the Hindu gods Shiva and Ganesh respectively. Po Nagar Cham Towers are situated on the high ground of Mount Cu Lau on the bank of River Cai, a few kilometres north from the city centre.",

      "Description": "Long Son Pagoda, also known as Chua Long Son, is situated on the foothill of Trai Thuy Mountain in the city of Nha Trang. The temple is famous for its large white Buddha image, which sits atop the mountain crest and can be seen from anywhere in town. Built in 1886 in the style of Taoist architecture, Long Son Pagoda has been home to many high-ranking Buddhist monks and the Vietnam Buddhist Studies Foundation was founded here in 1936. After being destroyed by a cyclone in 1990, the whole complex was rebuilt at the present site further down the hill. In its attempt to recreate the exact replica of the old temple, Long Son underwent many restorations and additions, interrupted at times by the Vietnam War and civil unrests. The white Buddha image was constructed much later in 1964. Today, Long Son Pagoda boasts beautiful and unique turn-of-the-century Taoist architecture characterised by the embellishment of mythical animals and sculptures of Taoist gods. It is also a working monastery complete with a school for monks in its grounds. An impressive three-tier roofed entrance, decorated with mosaic dragons, leads to the large temple grounds decorated by potted topiary. Behind the temple, 152 steps lead to the main attraction of Long Son Pagoda, the 24-metre tall white Buddha image seated on a lotus throne. Around the corner, there is a large reclining Buddha whose back panel features a bas-relief representation of the monks and nuns who died in the late 1950s while protesting against the corrupt US-backed Diem regime. From the platform at the base of the white Buddha, visitors can enjoy a bird’s eye view of Nha Trang and the sea beyond.",

      "Description": "Nha Trang Cathedral is the largest church in the city. Set atop a hill that overlooks Nha Trang Train Station, it was constructed in provincial French Gothic style by Priest Louis Vallet during the early 19th century. Na Thrang Cathedral serves the local Catholic community, with Mass being held between 05:00 and 18:30 on a daily basis. It's locally known as the stone church or Nui Church in Nha Trang. A popular spot for wedding and landscape photography, Nha Trang Cathedral is made entirely of stone and features beautiful stained glass windows, as well as a square clock tower that’s surmounted by a large crucifix. Its three cathedral bells, which were cast in France in 1789, are still in working order. There are also hints of Vietnamese influences to the structure, such as pink backlight on the tabernacle, red neon light outlining the crucifix, blue neon on the arch, and a white neon-lit halo atop St. Mary’s statue. Outside, Cathedral of Nha Trang are decorated with numerous statues of saints as well as 4,000 tombstones mounted on the sides, which were placed after the neighbouring cemetery was levelled in 1988 to extend the city train station. A must-visit for any first-time visitor, Nha Trang Cathedral remains one of the coastal town’s most important remnants of French architecture. From Nha Trang city, there are two paths which lead up to the cathedral. Visitors can either take a 53-step stone stairway from Thai Nguyan Street to the church entrance or another stone pathway from the city square which will lead them to the yard behind the church.",
